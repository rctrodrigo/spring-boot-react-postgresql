## Preface

The aim of this project is to implement an application called `loan-calculator-web-app` to calculate monthly payment and 
total payment based on the loan amount, annual interest rate, and number of years entered by the user. This project uses 
[Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/index.html) as a back-end application and [React](https://react.dev/) as a front-end application. Besides, it uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database.
